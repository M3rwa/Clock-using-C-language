# Digital Clock

This code implements a digital clock using C programming language and the graphics.h library. The digital clock is displayed on a graphics window and shows the current time accurately. It utilizes various mathematical calculations and functions to create the clock hands and update them dynamically.

## Prerequisites

- Turbo C++ compiler or any C compiler that supports the graphics.h library.

## Installation

1. Open the Turbo C++ compiler or your preferred C compiler.
2. Create a new source file and copy the provided code into it.
3. Save the file with a ".c" extension (e.g., digital_clock.c).
4. Compile and run the code using the compiler.

## Usage

- The digital clock will be displayed in a graphics window.
- The hour hand is represented by a red line.
- The minute hand is represented by a blue line.
- The second hand is represented by a green line.
- The clock updates every second to display the current time accurately.
